This data analysis project is an attempt to study the frequency and type of natural disasters in the US along with the trend followed by popoular agro-commodities stocks. 
Data for disasters was obtained from: OpenFEMA Data Sets. Data for stock prices was obtained from YFinance. 
Below is the resulting grapghs from the DA: 

Let's look at the result from one year: Here, we can somewhat observe a pattern in the number of calamities and the stock close price for AGRO. This was done for every year from 1990-2024.

Below is a bar-graph which helps visualise the total number of calamities per year, along with the individual contributions of each type of calamity. This was done after selecting a time range from the original dataset, then grouping by calamity type and count according to year. This is a good visualisation of trends and patterns in calamities in the US.

Further scope for this includes: Averaging out agro-commodities index like Goldman Sachs Commodities Index to see how they move with natural calamities in the US.
